Now, when your text input is large, you need to be able to create the dictionary object without having to load the entire text file.

The good news is Gensim lets you read the text and update the dictionary, one line at a time, without loading the entire text file into system memory. Let’s see how to do that in the next 2 sections.

But, before we get in, let’s understand some NLP jargon.

A ‘token’ typically means a ‘word’. A ‘document’ can typically refer to a ‘sentence’ or ‘paragraph’ and a ‘corpus’ is typically a ‘collection of documents as a bag of words’. That is, for each document, a corpus contains each word’s id and its frequency count in that document. As a result, information of the order of words is lost.

If everything is clear so far, let’s get our hands wet and see how to create the dictionary from a list of sentences.
